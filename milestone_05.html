	<h1>Milestone 5</h1>
	<h2>Question 1- Briefly describe each dataset based upon the information from the web site.</h2>
	<p>White space or blank space in code doesn't always correlate to blank space on the browser setting.  Most of the time the use of code like h1 and h2 creates heading and subheadings which go underneath each other.</p>
	<h2>Question 2- Examine each file using either gdalinfo or ogrinfo (depending upon whether it
		is a raster or vector data product), and answer the following questions about
		each data set:</h2>
	<p>h1 and h2 are displayed different because h1 is an overall heading and h2 is a heading underneath h1, so a subheading.</p>
	<h2>Question 3- Use proj or cs2cs (I suggest you use cs2cs) to calculate the coordinates of
		the spatial extent of the datasets that you downloaded in UTM Zone 13N, NAD27.
		Paste the input and output of the command(s) into your writeup.</h2>
	<p>You would use the li element</p>
