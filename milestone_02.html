	<h1>Milestone #2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>Blank space, caused by indentations or spacing allows the code to understand which texts have subtext and subheadings etc.  Multiple enters after code has been entered won't mean that there are multiple lines of blank space on the actual website.</p>
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>H1 is the main heading "lab assignment" and H2 are the subheadings labled question 1, 2, etc.  It distinguishes between main headings and sub headings.</p>
	<h2>Question n</h2>
	<p>For data lists you would use the code p and /p.</p>
