	<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>White space or blank space in code doesn't always correlate to blank space on the browser setting.  h1 is the largest "header" font, h2 is smaller and so on.  h4 and p are nearly the same font without stlying.</p>
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>h1 and h2 are displayed different because h1 is an overall heading and h2 is a heading underneath h1, so a subheading.  h3, h4 etc as the number behind h gets bigger, the font gets smaller.</p>
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>You would use the ul and li element</p>
