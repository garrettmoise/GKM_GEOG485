	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<h3>What is the high-level description of the problem/question you want to help answer through the presentation of a collection of geographic data over the internet? Please answer in a short paragraph.</h3>
	<p>I want to research and analyze the distribution of fire stations in New Mexico in relation to wildfire severity.  I will take into account the different Emergency Managment centers and the mountain ranges of New Mexico in analyzing this relationship.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<h3>Who is the target audience for the information you want to provide?</h3>
	<p>The target audience, first off, is anyone interested.  I would also like to think that fire stations and wildfire monitors would be interested in the analysis.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<h3>What geographic region does your problem area represent? Please describe it in words (e.g. New Mexico, Alberta Canada, etc.) and define it in terms of a geographic (WGS84) (latitude and longitude) bounding box.</h3>
	<p>Bounding Coordinates<br>
West Bounding Coordinate -109.051338195801<br>
East Bounding Coordinate -102.998901367187<br>
North Bounding Coordinate 37.0017471313477<br>
South Bounding Coordinate 31.3308715820312<br></p>
  <br>
  <h2>Question 4</h2>
  <h3>What types of data do you want to include in your project? Include a description (data content: e.g. elevation data, hydrographic survey, etc.) and types (i.e. raster, vector).</h3>
  <p>I'd like to go with a USGS Topo WMS Basemap, two HSIP Emergency Management layers (which are both vector data), an NM Burn Severity GeoTIFF, and a vector layer of NM Mountain Ranges.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
	<h3>What projection will you use for the presentation of your project data? Again, describe it, provide your reasoning for selection, and provide the corresponding EPSG code.</h3>
	<p>I am going to use WGS 1984.  The reason for this is that all of my layers, except for the WMS Basemap, are in this projection.  The corresponding EPSG Code is EPSG:4326</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Question 6</h2>
	<h3>Where do you anticipate acquiring data for the project from?</h3>
	<p>I anticipate aquiring my data from RGIS and from USGS National Map webpages.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Question 7</h2>
	<h3>What barriers to acquiring and processing the needed data do you anticipate?</h3>
	<p>I think the hardest part about this project is finding data that will work with one another.  I also need to find data that will display in the same projection.</p>
