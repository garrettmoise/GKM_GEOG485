<p>Add three WMS layers to a new map project in QGIS, with one coming from each of the following collections of WMS services.
<br>
Some things to keep an eye out for:<br>
•Any scale limits described for the various layers<br>
•Layer names can sometimes be a bit confusing<br>
•You can double-check the base URL advertised for the service by reviewing the content of the GetCapabilities area of the service metadata provided as part of the GetCapabilities request.<br>

USGS's National Maps Service Endpoints Page: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/example/services/serviceList.html<br>

NRCS Soil Data Mart WMS Service: http://SDMDataAccess.nrcs.usda.gov/Spatial/SDM.wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities<br>

In your write-up include the names of the layers you added, which service they came from, and screen shots (one for for each of the added layers) showing each of them in the QGIS client interface.<br>

Add three WFS layers to the same QGIS project, two based upon data available from the RGIS data browser (http://rgis.unm.edu/browsedata), and one based on the USGS GeoNames WFS service (http://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services/WFS/geonames/MapServer/WFSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WFS.<br>
