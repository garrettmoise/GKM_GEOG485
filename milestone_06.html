	<h4></h4>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</h4>
	<p>The first few links were more for informational purposes.  Each of them tried to explain what WMS services are and what to do with them.  A page away were some live WMS services.</p>
	<h2>Question 4A</h2>
	<h4>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?</h4>

	<h4>What is the Name of the service?</h4>
	<li>OGC: WMS</li>
	<h4>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?</h4>
	<li>png</li>

	<h4>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</h4>
	<li>185</li>
	<h2>Question 4B</h2>
